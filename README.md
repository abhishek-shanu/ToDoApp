This is a simple ToDo App which performs the CRUD operations asynchronously,thus making our application fast and user friendly.

For the backend  part I have used  NodeJs to connect the server and mongodb for the database.

I have also applied security measures like user authentication and disallowing any kind of html tags or query to run in the input box. 

you can see the app using these credentials:
url: "cr7todoapp.heroku.com"
username: learn
password: javascript
